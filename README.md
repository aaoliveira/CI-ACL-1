CI-ACL
======

Simple Codeigniter ACL

PHP 5.3 (Should be OK for php 5.2)
Codeigniter 2.1.2 (Should be OK for any version 2 branch)

This is a very simple Role Based Access Control List RBACL which does not require
a database.

It allows you to generate roles for users on a per controller/object bases.
I have taken the idea from the Drupal ACL but much simpler method.
